        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Motion is a web-based animation software which runs entirely on the client-side.
            Its graphics are powered by SVG elements.
            When you open Motion, you open to a tile-based window manager.
            Each window contains a view from the underlying model-view-controller architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
            The system uses both many views (canvases, renderers, shape editors) as well as many models (types of shapes, tweens).
            There is a single controller which manages the entire application.
            The controller manages all interactions between views and models.
            A view cannot directly modify a model and a model cannot directly interact with a view.
            However, a view is able to read the attributes of a model.
        </p>
        <p>
            Views interact with the controller by accessing the global controller and subscribing to their interest.
            For example, a canvas subscribes to the shape currently on the screen, while a shape editor only subscribes to shapes that are selected.
            Views can further interact with the controller, for example if they receive an input from the user and want to relay this.
            However, it is the responsibility of the controller to validate the functions that views call on it.
        </p>
        <p>
            A controller can only interact with views that have subscribed to it.
            A controller can at any point modify or run functions on a model.
            However, a model can never call functions on the controller or any views.
            The only means by which a model can interact with the controller is by returning outputs when the controller calls a function on it.
            A model only speaks when spoken to.
        </p>

    <section id="controller">
        <h2>Controller</h2>

        <p>The controller lives in the following three states:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>idle</li>
            <li>receiving action</li>
            <li>playing</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            While the controller is idle it can begin playing or it can begin receiving an action.
            When the controller is receiving an action, it is waiting for a view to give it steps on what to do.
            This allows it to differentiate when an action starts and ends, and can undo/redo accordingly.
            Playing means the animation is currently being previewed, and as such no actions are allowed.
        </p>

        <p>The following functions can be called on the controller by views:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>beginAction - enters the receiving action state</li>
            <li>takeStep - does something specified by parameters</li>
            <li>endAction - exits the receiving action state</li>
            <li>subscribeTo - the controller adds this to one of its list of subscribers based on parameters</li>
            <li>play - enters the playing state</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            The controller will be able to call a variety of functions on views based on what they subscribed to.
            It is the responsibility of the controller to both (a) validate function calls made to it and (b)
            ensure it makes correct function calls to views and models (i.e. views and models do not need to validate
            controller function calls).
